# Heated Highways
The warmest way across campus!

## Inspiration
The worst part of being on campus in the winter is by far the weather. Having to walk from place to place in -40 is just a nightmare. of course, the U of A has pedways that might allow you to take a warmer route but that can get confusing, who even knows where they all are!

## What it does
That's where our project comes in! By selecting two points on campus our program will find you the warmest route from point a to b!

## What's next for us
right now it's only running with a python UI but we hope in the future to turn it into a full-fledged app
